summary: "Non-negative matrix factorization with interactive visualization"
---

[NMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) stands for **N**on-negative **M**atrix **F**actoriaztion, also known as PMPMF (positive matrix factorization). This app combines interactive visualization for data exploration, principal components analysis ([PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)), and NMF. Here are the steps:

1. Upload your own data or use the example data set. You will need concentrations (non-negative multivariate data), associated uncertainties (optional), and spatial coordinates ([WGS 84](https://epsg.io/4326) coordinate system); [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file format is expected.

2. Explore correlations among the variables using the interactive heatmap (highlight rows/columns, zoom in/out).

3. On the PCA tab, you can explore the 2D PCA plot and the map, with concentrations from a selected point (hover over it) shown.

4. On the NMF tab, you can select the the number of runs for each of the different factorization ranks (2--7 are run by default), then select the rank to be shown (convergence diagnostics, factor profiles). Going back to the PCA tab, you'll be able to see factor loadings for the selected location.
