Quality [control charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart) (QCC) are used to study how
a process changes over time. The application lets you upload and interact with a data set to determine if the process is well controlled.

QCCs are most often used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in control.
The plot consists of a series of points showing measurements as a function of time. Based on some baseline data, limits of a controlled process are established. There are different [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart#Types_of_charts) of QCCs that differ in how these limits are determined.
The process is deemed out of control when subsequent observations get outside of the limits.

The following animation shows how to plot various three different kinds of
control charts:

1. upload your _data_ ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file format) or use the example data set,
2. define the column for _dates_ and column for measured _parameters_,
3. select the _type_ of chart (Shewhart, cumulative sum [CUSUM], or exponentially weighted moving average [EWMA]),
4. inspect the plot, or explore the data set.
