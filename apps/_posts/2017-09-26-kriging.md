[Kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) is a geostatistical tool to interpolate between spatially referenced measurements. Kriging is often used in hydrogeology, mining, and remote sensing. This application helps visualizing the data and the kriging based interpolated output.

The kriging interpolation incorporates the spatial inter-dependence of the data points by fitting a variogram model. The output is a prediction surface that can be visualized as raster heatmaps, or contours.

You can zoom in and out, and change the base map in the interactive map.
The animation below shows the workflow:

1. upload your _data_ ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file format, [WGS 84](https://epsg.io/4326) coordinate system) and select _longitude_, _latitude_, and _value_ columns (you can also use an example data set),
2. interactively edit the map to subset the observations and inspect the distribution of values ([Box-Cox transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform#Box.E2.80.93Cox_transformation) is done when necessary),
3. pick a [_variogram_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram) model, view and download the predictions in [Geo TIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) raster format.

**Note:** large (*n* > 1000) data sets are randomly sampled (*n* = 1000) to speed up calculations.
